            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>


        <p>Modern multi-millionaires may live by the phrase "time is money" so for them, Bentley offers the 2020 Mulsanne Speed. It's the perfect vehicle for getting them to and from meetings with their money managers without wasting a single, precious moment. If you're only merely rich and so must pilot your own luxury land yacht, the Mulsanne Speed offers a more engaging driving experience than the regular Mulsanne sedan. But the real way to enjoy it is from the rear seat while being hastily shuttled to your destination by an expert chauffer. It's not the most modern car in Bentley's lineup, but it offers a brand of old-school luxuriousness that few cars today can match. And it looks every inch born to the job.

            <h3>What's New for 2021?</h3>
        </div>
        
        <p>The Mulsanne Speed carries over without any meaningful changes for 2020.</p>

            <h4>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Rival luxury sedans such as the Rolls-Royce Ghost and Phantom or the Mercedes-Maybach S650 are powered by V-12 engines, but the Mulsanne Speed squeezes 530-hp out of a 6.75-liter twin-turbo V-8. And this big limo can really haul; at our test track it zipped to 60 mph in just 4.8-seconds. But don't fret—despite the Speed's more sporting nature, it retains all of the luxury that one expects of a Bentley. Racier styling bits such as carbon fiber trim set it apart from the rest of the range; adjustable dampers and air springs tighten things up while still providing a smooth ride.</p>

            <h5>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h5>
        </div>
        <p>Considering the Mulsanne Speed's size and performance potential, fuel economy ratings are expectedly low. The EPA estimates that the 2020 Mulsanne will return 10 mpg in the city, 16 mpg on the highway, and 12 mpg combined. Even full-size pickup trucks have the Mulsanne beat in this category, but we're guessing that if a $350,000 price tag doesn't turn you off, a big bill at the gas station won't either.</p>

            <h6>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h6>
        </div>
        <p>Whereas the regular Mulsanne is made for luxuriating in the rear while Jeeves dutifully transports you from point A to point B, the Mulsanne Speed is actually made for driving. For those times when you'd rather be chauffeured, however, the Speed's cabin is equally as lavish as the standard Mulsanne's, with rich, carefully stitched leather throughout, huge expanses of beautifully finished wood trim, and even an optional champagne bottle chiller with crystal champagne flutes. Rear-seat riders can utilize the fold-down picnic tables to enjoy their in-flight meal or catch up on emails on their laptop. Cargo space isn't as generous as the Mulsanne Speed's size would have you believe, but there's enough space for a pair of suitcases for a weekend away.

        <div class="heading">
            <h7>Infotainment and Connectivity</h7>
        </div>
        <p>The Mulsanne Speed comes with an 8.0-inch infotainment touchscreen in its dashboard and a 14-speaker stereo system. A rear-seat entertainment system is available and consists of two 10.4-inch displays mounted to the backs of the front seats; it can even be optioned with a TV tuner. For those who value high-end audio, a Naim stereo system is optional.

            <h8>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</h8>
                <p>Neither U.S. safety agency—the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)—have performed crash testing on the Mulsanne Speed. Driver-assistance features such as blind-spot monitoring and automatic high-beam headlamps are standard, but Bentley charges extra for adaptive cruise control. Key safety features include:

                *Standard forward collision warning with automated emergency braking
                *Standard blind-spot monitoring
                *Available adaptive cruise control</p>

            <h9>Warranty and Maintenance Coverage</h9>
        </div>
        <p>Bentley's standard warranty isn't limited by mileage but lasts just three years. Chief rival Rolls-Royce offers a four-year warranty plus covers maintenance for up to four years.

            *Limited warranty covers three years or unlimited miles
            *Powertrain warranty covers three years or unlimited miles
            *Complimentary maintenance is covered for 1 year or 10,000 miles</p>
