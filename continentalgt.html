            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>


        <p>The Continental GT has been the go-to choice of both ballers and CEOs for more than a decade and the 2020 model is the best one yet. The Continental GT—offered as both a coupe and a convertible—kick-started the resurgence of the Bentley brand and has succeeded where other luxury two-doors and droptops have failed to maintain the interest of the buying public. It's the Continental's elegant styling and posh interior fitments that stand as the model's biggest draws.

            <h3>What's New for 2021?</h3>
        </div>
        
        <p>For 2019, the Continentals were redesigned and reverently restyled, riding on a new body structure and using a quick-shifting eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission to enhance the model's elegance and performance. As in years past, two engines will be available: a twin-turbocharged V-8 and a twin-turbocharged W-12. The Continental GT's interior also underwent a full redesign for 2019.</p>

            <h4>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h4>
        </div>
        <p>Updated versions of the existing V-8 and W-12 engines that powered the previous generation Continental GT provide ample power. Our testing revealed that the V-8, which makes 542 horsepower, can launch the Continental coupe to 60 mph in 3.4 seconds. The more expensive W-12 engine produces 626 horsepower and can motivate a coupe to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds. Both use a new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission that snaps off super-quick but smooth gearshifts. Both coupes and convertibles can be ordered with either engine. All Continental GTs come with an all-wheel-drive system as standard.</p>

            <h5>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h5>
        </div>
        <p>When a twin-turbo V-8 is the more fuel efficient of the two engines offered in a particular model, you know that mpg is not top of mind for a carmaker—or its customers, for that matter. The EPA rates the Continental V-8 at 16 mpg city and 26 highway. In our real-world testing, we averaged 28 mpg in a V-8 model over 200 miles of highway driving.</p>

            <h6>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h6>
        </div>
        <p>We expect a luxurious cabin from anything wearing the Bentley badge, and this two-door is no different. The interior is swathed in aromatic leather and fine wood veneers, and nearly everything about the Continental GT is customizable—for a price. Bentley's designers thought everything through, and each time behind the wheel reveals a surprising detail, such as expertly knurled control knobs and double-stitched diamond-patterned seat trim. Although the Continental GT technically has seatbelts for four occupants, we'd suggest avoiding using the rear seat for hauling people since its leg- and headroom are both limited. In our testing, we were able to fit five carry-on-sized suitcases in the Continental's trunk—plenty of space for a weekend away with your favorite travel companion.</p>

            <h7>Infotainment and Connectivity</h7>
        </div>
        <p>A 12.3-inch infotainment display dominates the dashboard and can be made to rotate out from its hidden place behind three small analog gauges that display the exterior air temperature, the time, and a compass. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability are standard, as is a digital gauge display that allows the driver to control most of the Continental GT's functions using controls on the steering wheel. The Continental GT offers two optional audio systems: a $6700 Bang & Olufsen arrangement and a truly spectacular $8800 Naim system.

            <h8>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</h8>
        </div>
        <p>This vehicle has not been rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Bentley offers as options driver-assistance features such as adaptive cruise control, a night-vision system, and automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection—items we'd expect to be standard, considering the steep starting price. Key safety features include:

            *Available automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection
            *Available lane-departure warning with lane-keeping assist
            *Available adaptive cruise control</p>

            <h9>Warranty and Maintenance Coverage</h9>
        </div>
        <p>Rather than put mileage limits on the Continental GT's standard warranty policies, Bentley covers everything for three years regardless of how far the car is driven. The company also provides the first maintenance visit with their compliments at one year or 10,000 miles.

            *Limited warranty covers 3 years or unlimited miles
            *Powertrain warranty covers 3 years or unlimited miles
            *Complimentary maintenance is covered for 1 year or 10,000 miles</p>
