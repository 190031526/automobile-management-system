            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>


        <p>Beyond its unmistakably British branding and endless James Bond references,
             Aston Martin has a reputation for building fast and fabulous sports cars such as the 2020 DB11.
              Not only does the 2+2 grand tourer catch the eye and trigger dopamine releases,
               it's available with a pair of twin-turbocharged engines that sound fantastic and go like stink.
                While the twin-turbo V-12 is only available on the track-oriented AMR model, 
                both the regular coupe and Volante convertible benefit from a velvety twin-turbo V-8.
                 Topless or not, the Aston's cabin is beautiful and extremely customizable. 
                 The 2020 DB11 also transitions from swanky boulevard cruiser to corner-carving terror at the driver's desire.
                </p>

            <h3>What's New for 2020?</h3>
        </div>
        
        <p>While we love the more voracious nature of the higher-performance AMR variant,
             it's not necessarily the best example of a grand tourer.
              Instead, we think the convertible Volante is the quintessential DB11 experience.
               Unfortunately, those who want the added character of the V-12 engine will be disappointed, 
               because the drop-top is only sold with the V-8.
                After selecting our preferred paint color and exterior trimmings from the myriad options,
                 and subsequently sorting through the vast interior configurations,
                  we'd add the Bang & Olufsen audio system and touchpad control for the infotainment system.
                   The only other extras we'd recommend are the heated steering wheel for cold days and the 
                   blind-spot monitor to help watch our back from other drivers who are too distracted by the 
                   rarity of our DB11 to see our turn signals.</p>

        <div class="heading">
            <h4>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h4>
        </div>
        <p>The DB11 offers two very distinct engine choices: a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 or a twin-turbo 5.2-liter V-12.
             The former develops 503 horsepower and 498 lb-ft of torque while the latter produces 630 ponies and 516 lb-ft.
              Both pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission that transmits all that power to the rear wheels.
               We've only tested a detuned version of the V-12 DB11 that made 600 horsepower and showed serious quickness, 
               but Aston has abandoned the V-12 on non-AMR models. However, we most recently drove the DB11 AMR in northern
                Germany. There its massive thrust and athletic moves combined with an exhaust note that was equally melodic 
                and menacing. We've also driven but haven't track-tested both V-8 versions.
                 The DB11 coupe proved that fewer cylinders can be similarly quick and sound just as badass.
                  Likewise, the drop-top DB11 Volante we drove was a stunning way to experience the south of France.
                   While it's not available with the V-12,
             the Volante thankfully doesn't sacrifice performance.</p>

            <h5>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h5>
        </div>
        <p>With a powerful V-8 and V-12 as the only engine choices on the 2020 DB11, fuel economy is clearly a low priority.
             Still, the V-8 has respectable EPA estimates of 18 mpg city and 24 highway. 
             The 12-cylinder alternative is less thrifty, with ratings of 15 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway.For comparison,
             the W-12–powered Bentley Continental GT is even less efficient at 12 mpg city and 20 highway. We haven't had a chance to test an Aston with either engine on our 75-mph fuel-economy route, so we can't evaluate its real-world mpg.</p>

        <div class="heading">
            <h6>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h6>
        </div>
        <p>As expected, the inside of every DB11 is a plush environment that can be customized with fanciful leather 
            colors and exotic materials. However, we've noticed some inconsistent panel fitment and surprisingly 
            cheap-feeling switchgear. Still, these issues are minor compared with the otherwise extravagant and
             heart-pounding experience. Every model includes leather upholstery, heated and power-adjustable front seats,
              and passive entry. Those who want more upscale features can add a heated steering wheel and ventilated front seats.
               Unfortunately, there are not many places to store small 
            items inside the DB11 outside of the center-console bin that slides open to reveal cupholders and a useful tray.</p>

        <div class="heading">
            <h7>Infotainment and Connectivity</h7>
        </div>
        <p>The infotainment system is derived from Mercedes-Benz, with user-friendly controls and attractive menus. 
            The 8.0-inch screen is controlled via a standard rotary controller as well as an available touchpad on the 
            center console. Along with a 400-watt audio system and SiriusXM satellite radio, Aston gives every DB11 a Wi-Fi hotspot. 
            Shoppers can upgrade to either a 700-watt sound system or a 1000-watt Bang & Olufsen unit.</p>

            <h8>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</h8>
        </div>
        <p>The 2020 DB11 hasn't been crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Those interested in driver-assistance technology can add blind-spot monitoring and auto parking that helps the driver—you guessed it—park. Key safety features include:

            *Standard 360-degree camera system
            *Standard front and rear parking sensors
            *Available self-park assist</p>

            <h9>Warranty and Maintenance Coverage</h9>
        </div>
        <p>Aston Martin provides a limited and powertrain warranty that are competitive with other high-end automakers such as Bentley. However, the company doesn't offer any complimentary maintenance as many of its competitors do.

            *Limited warranty covers three years and unlimited miles
            *Powertrain warranty covers three years and unlimited miles
            *No complimentary scheduled maintenance</p>
