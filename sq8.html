            <h2>Overview</h2>
        </div>


        <p>The 2021 Audi SQ8 slots into the Q lineup above the mild Q8 and below the wild RS Q8; and with 500 horses on tap, it should satisfy most speed freaks. The cabin is just as nicely equipped as the standard Q8's, with the latest in Audi's infotainment tech taking center stage, but the SQ8 offers slightly racier styling in the form of diamond-stitched leather seats and carbon-fiber accents. A more aggressive exterior design differentiates the SQ8 from the entry-level ute but doesn't shout its sportiness quite as loud as the RS Q8 halo model. Unique wheels, quad tailpipes, and a distinctive grille are all exclusive to the SQ8. This Audi competes against some of our favorite two-row performance SUVs, such as the Porsche Cayenne and the Mercedes-AMG GLE-class. If you're looking for something with three rows, Audi also offers the SQ7, which is similar in both style and performance but has room for seven.

            <h3>What's New for 2021?</h3>
        </div>
        
        <p>For its sophomore year, the SQ8 soldiers on with only one change: It now comes standard with a built-in toll-road-payment transmission feature.</p>

        <div class="heading">
            <h4>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h4>
        </div>
        <p>A twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 will power the SQ8, and it will provide 500 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque. The model comes standard with Quattro all-wheel drive and an eight-speed automatic transmission. Though we haven't yet driven the S, we did test its lesser sibling, the 2019 Audi Q8, and that proved plenty quick and effectively sporty with just 355 horsepower and 369 pound-feet; so we have high hopes for this one, given its extra power and specially tuned chassis. Audi claims that the SQ8 and the mechanically similar three-row SQ7 can hit 60 in a respectable 4.3 seconds.

            <h5>Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h5>
        </div>
        <p>According to the EPA, the SQ8 is good for 15 mpg in the city, 21 mpg on the highway, and 17 mpg combined. We haven't had the chance to put it through our 200-mile highway fuel-economy test to see how it performs in the real world, but when we do, we'll update this story with results.</p>

            <h6>Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h6>
        </div>
        <p>As is typical of Audi's S models, the interior gains more standard features and fancier materials than the base vehicle. This includes black accents in the cabin and diamond-stitched seats as well as optional carbon-fiber trim and contrast stitching. With seating for give, the spacious back seat and capacious cargo area are useful on road trips. Unfortunately, interior cubby storage is subpar.</p>

        <div class="heading">
            <h7>Infotainment and Connectivity</h7>
        </div>
        <p>Audi decks out every SQ8 with a dual-touchscreen infotainment system and the brand's Virtual Cockpit reconfigurable gauge display. The almost completely digital cabin will appeal to tech-conscious buyers but not those who value physical controls for things like climate control. A Wi-Fi hotspot and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration are standard fare.</p>

            <h8>Safety and Driver-Assistance Features</h8>
        </div>
        <p>The SQ8 hasn't completed crash testing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). That said, the Q8 earned a five-star rating from NHTSA and a Top Safety Pick honor from IIHS. Audi offers a suite of driver-assistance features on this model. Key safety features include:

            *Standard forward-collision warning with automated emergency braking
            *Standard blind-spot monitoring with rear-cross-traffic alert
            *Available adaptive cruise control with a semi-autonomous driving mode</p>

            <h9>Warranty and Maintenance Coverage</h9>
        </div>
        <p>Audi provides the same limited and powertrain warranty as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The SQ8 also includes four years of 24-hour roadside assistance and a brief complimentary-scheduled-maintenance period.

            *Limited warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles
            *Powertrain warranty covers four years or 50,000 miles
            *Complimentary maintenance is covered for one year or 10,000 miles</p>
